# dataset-format-converter-
This repository contains code for converting datasets in different formats. 

As a student or professional it is a lot of pain to convert dataset labels from one format to another. As we see YOLO has a different set of rules and format for its segmentation and detection models. Building a U-net will require labels in a different format and so do many other open-source models used for segmentation and detection. So I thought of creating this repo containing code to convert labels from one format to another.

The files and their function:-

1.coconew: Converts Jason to Yolo format for multi-class segmentation and detection models.
